# Stock_Price_Predictions_Using_regression

### I trained a ridge regression model to predict future stock prices. By accurately predicting stock prices, investors can maximize returns and know when to buy/sell securities.The model is trained using historical stock price data along with the volume of transcations.

## Stocks Considerd:

### AAPL = Apple Stock 
### BA = Boeing 
### T = AT&T
### MGM = MGM Resorts International (Hotel Industry)
### AMZN = Amazon
### IBM = IBM
### TSLA = Tesla Motors
### GOOG = Google 
### sp500 = US Stock Market (S&P 500 is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. stock exchange)

Check the list of S&P 500 companies here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies
